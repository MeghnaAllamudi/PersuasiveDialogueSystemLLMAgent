Architected and implemented an AI agent system that dynamically adjusts persuasion techniques based on real-time user feedback. 
Built using a Neo4J knowledge graph to model conversational state transitions, the system leverages LangChain tools to enable the LLM to strategically select from multiple persuasion paradigms. 
Implemented an automated feedback loop with sentiment analysis capabilities that triggers strategy backtracking when detecting negative user responses, creating a self-optimizing conversational system that continuously refines its approach through interaction data. 
This research explored foundational challenges in creating autonomous agents with strategic decision-making capabilities and environmental adaptation.
